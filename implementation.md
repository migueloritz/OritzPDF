## Architecture Decisions

1. **FastAPI**: Chosen for async support and automatic API documentation
2. **PyMuPDF**: Primary PDF processor for performance
3. **Hybrid OCR**: Tesseract for layout + Cloud for accuracy
4. **Redis**: Caching layer for performance
5. **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for metadata
6. **Pydantic**: Data validation and serialization

## Next Steps

1. Implement storage service
2. Create database models
3. Build PDF processing pipeline
4. Add error handling and logging
